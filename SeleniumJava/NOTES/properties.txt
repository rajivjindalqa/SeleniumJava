for the properties file you need to create a .property file. It is used to store the configurations 


Below is the code required to setup and call the file:

			Properties prop = new Properties();
			InputStream io = new FileInputStream(SystemPath+ "/src/test/java/config/config.properties");
			prop.load(io);
			String value = prop.getProperty("name of property for which you want to fetch the value");
