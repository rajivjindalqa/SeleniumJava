Listeners basically listen to your test cases and give you the flexibility to perform certain action during execution. 
YOu can define what to do before/after execution, before / after test case run, on skip, pass, fail etc.
Creating listeners has below steps required:

1. create a java class and implement the listener interface to it (ITestListener is one of the interface. You can check for more such interfaces. Then add the implemented methods as following:

public class sample implements ITestListener {

	public void onTestStart(ITestResult result) {
		System.out.println("---------------TEST STARTED"+result.getName());

	}

	public void onTestSuccess(ITestResult result) {
		System.out.println("---------------TEST PASSED"+result.getName());
	}

	public void onTestFailure(ITestResult result) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		System.out.println("---------------TEST FAILED"+result.getName());

	}
	
	
2. Then you can refer this listener call in test case class in two ways:
	a) Adding following above class: @Listeners(listners.TestNGListners.class)
	b) Adding the listeners at suite level in testng.xml file as following (it will work for all classes or packages you will be defining in this file.
		 	<suite name="demo">

				<listeners>
					<listener class-name="listners.TestNGListners" />
				</listeners>
